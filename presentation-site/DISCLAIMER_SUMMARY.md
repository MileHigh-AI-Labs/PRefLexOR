# Disclaimer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive disclaimers throughout the PRefLexOR presentation to clarify that all quantified benefits are framework-based projections rather than measured data.

## âœ… Disclaimers Added

### 1. Executive Summary (executive-summary.qmd)
- **Individual Impact Claims**: Added asterisks (*) to all six business use case impact percentages
- **ROI Example**: Added disclaimer noting "Example calculation based on framework projections"
- **Comprehensive Disclaimer**: Added prominent warning box before Implementation Roadmap explaining framework methodology

### 2. Technical Deep Dive (technical-deep-dive.qmd) 
- **Section Title**: Changed "Quantifiable Benefits" to "Projected Benefits Framework*"
- **Diagram Labels**: Added asterisks to all benefit percentages in Mermaid diagram
- **ROI Section**: Retitled to "ROI Calculation Framework Example*" with framework notes
- **Methodology Disclaimer**: Added comprehensive warning before Future Directions section

### 3. Index Page (index.qmd)
- **Footer Disclaimer**: Added general note about framework-based estimates

### 4. Visual Guide (visual-guide.qmd)
- **Footer Disclaimer**: Added specific note about illustrative frameworks and pilot validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Disclaimer Language Strategy

### **Asterisk System (*)**
- Simple asterisks mark all quantified claims
- Directs attention to framework nature of projections

### **Framework Language**
- Emphasizes "framework-based projections" 
- Uses "methodology" and "calculation framework"
- Avoids claiming actual measured results

### **Validation Requirements**
- All disclaimers mention need for pilot programs
- Emphasizes customization for specific organizations
- Notes that actual results will vary

### **Warning Box Styling**
- Uses `.alert-box .alert-warning` for visibility
- Prominent placement before key sections
- Professional but clear cautionary tone

## ðŸ“‹ Key Disclaimer Components

### **What We Clarify:**
1. **Source**: Framework-based projections, not measured data
2. **Variability**: Results depend on organization-specific factors
3. **Validation**: Requires pilot testing and customization
4. **Methodology**: Demonstrates calculation approach
5. **Business Case**: Framework for developing custom ROI analysis

### **What We Emphasize:**
- Framework provides systematic approach
- Methodology is sound and reusable
- Organizations should customize inputs
- Pilot programs essential for validation
- Business case development requires specific baseline data

## ðŸš€ Implementation Benefits

### **Legal Protection**
- Clear separation between framework and claims
