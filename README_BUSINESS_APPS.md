## Prerequisites

### 1. Ollama Setup
All applications require Ollama with a compatible model:

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull recommended model (choose one)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M    # Balanced (6GB RAM)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M    # Lightweight (2.5GB RAM)
ollama pull llama3.1:70b-instruct-q4_K_M   # High-performance (45GB RAM)
```

### 2. Python Environment
Each application has its own requirements.txt:

```bash
# For each application directory:
cd <application_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Individual Applications
Run each application separately:
```bash
# Financial Risk Assessment (Port 8501)
cd financialrisk && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

# Medical Diagnosis (Port 8502 - in new terminal)
cd medical_diagnosis && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502

# Supply Chain (Port 8503 - in new terminal)  
cd supply_chain && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8503

# Legal Analysis (Port 8504 - in new terminal)
cd legal_analysis && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8504

# Investment Research (Port 8505 - in new terminal)
cd investment_research && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8505

# Product Development (Port 8506 - in new terminal)
cd product_development && streamlit run app.py --server.port 8506
```

### Option 2: Application Launcher
Use the provided launcher script:
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x launch_apps.sh

# Run launcher
./launch_apps.sh
```

The launcher provides options to:
- Launch individual applications on specific ports
- Launch all applications simultaneously  
- Check application status
- Stop all running applications

## Application Architecture

Each application follows the same PRefLexOR pattern:

```
<application_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ollama_client.py   # Ollama integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py        # Domain-specific configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                 # Utility functions (when needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Application-specific documentation
```
