Patient Case: {patient_case}
"""

# Expected PRefLexOR Output
expected_output = """
<|thinking|>
**Symptom Pattern Analysis**:
- Classic triad: fatigue, joint pain, morning stiffness
- Duration: 6 months (chronic, not acute)
- Systemic symptoms: weight loss suggests inflammatory process

**Laboratory Interpretation**:
- RF positive + Anti-CCP elevated = strong RA indicators
- ESR 48 mm/hr (elevated, normal <30)
- CRP 12 mg/L (significantly elevated, normal <3)
- Pattern consistent with active inflammatory arthritis

**Differential Diagnosis Reasoning**:
1. Rheumatoid Arthritis (85% probability)
   - Meets ACR/EULAR criteria: RF+, Anti-CCP+, synovitis symptoms
   - Family history supports autoimmune predisposition
   
2. Psoriatic Arthritis (10% probability)
   - Less likely without skin manifestations
   - Would need skin examination

3. Lupus (5% probability)
   - Joint pain present but no other systemic features
   - Would need ANA testing

**Treatment Planning Considerations**:
- Early aggressive treatment improves outcomes
- DMARD therapy indicated for confirmed RA
- Need baseline imaging and additional labs
<|/thinking|>

**Primary Diagnosis**: Rheumatoid Arthritis (likely)

This 45-year-old patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms and laboratory findings highly suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. The combination of positive rheumatoid factor, elevated anti-CCP antibodies, and inflammatory markers supports this diagnosis.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Immediate**: Initiate methotrexate 15mg weekly + folic acid
2. **Monitoring**: Monthly CBC, liver function tests
3. **Imaging**: Baseline X-rays of hands/feet, consider ultrasound
4. **Follow-up**: Rheumatology consultation within 2 weeks

**Risk Factors**: Joint damage progression without early treatment, medication monitoring for hepatotoxicity.

    "indemnification": "mutual_limited_scope",
    "jurisdiction": "delaware_courts"
}

prompt = f"""
Analyze this software licensing agreement for legal risks and business implications. Use <|thinking|>.

Contract Terms: {contract_terms}
"""

# Expected PRefLexOR Output
expected_output = """
<|thinking|>
**Contract Structure Analysis**:
- 5-year term with auto-renewal: Long commitment with potential lock-in risk
- 30-day termination notice: Reasonable flexibility for exit
- Delaware jurisdiction: Standard for business contracts, favorable legal environment

**Risk Assessment by Category**:

1. **Financial/Liability Risks**:
   - Liability cap limited to direct damages only
   - Excludes consequential damages, lost profits
   - Analysis: MODERATE RISK - limits vendor accountability

2. **Data and IP Risks**:
   - Data ownership language is ambiguous
   - Could lead to disputes over derivative works, analytics
   - Analysis: HIGH RISK - needs clarification

3. **Operational Risks**:
   - Auto-renewal could create budget surprises
   - 30-day notice requirement manageable
   - Analysis: LOW-MODERATE RISK

**Legal Precedent Considerations**:
- Delaware courts generally favor clear contract interpretation
- Software licensing disputes often hinge on data ownership
- Industry standard liability limitations vary 20-80% of contract value

**Business Impact Assessment**:

- Strategic flexibility: Auto-renewal reduces negotiation opportunities
- Competitive implications: Data ownership affects future vendor options
<|/thinking|>

**Contract Risk Assessment**: MODERATE-HIGH risk profile requires amendments before execution.

This software licensing agreement contains several terms that could create significant business risks, particularly around data ownership and liability limitations.

**Critical Issues Identified**:

1. **Data Ownership Ambiguity** (HIGH RISK)
   - Current language could grant vendor rights to client data
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit clause: "Client retains all rights, title, and interest in Client Data"
   
2. **Liability Limitations** (MODERATE RISK)
   - Vendor liability capped at direct damages only
   - **Business Impact**: No recourse for system downtime affecting operations
   - **Recommendation**: Negotiate minimum liability floor of $500K for critical system failures

3. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism** (LOW-MODERATE RISK)
   - 5-year auto-renewal could lock in unfavorable terms
   - **Recommendation**: Change to 1-year auto-renewal or require explicit approval

**Recommended Contract Amendments**:
- Section 3.2: Clarify data ownership and usage rights
- Section 8.1: Increase liability cap for operational disruptions  
- Section 12.3: Modify auto-renewal to annual terms
- Add Section 15: Data portability requirements upon termination

**Business Recommendation**: Do not execute without amendments. Estimated negotiation cost ($15K legal fees) vs. risk mitigation value ($500K+ potential exposure).
