## Understanding the AI Reasoning

### Thinking Tokens Example

When you run an assessment, look for the **AI Reasoning** tab to see detailed thinking process:

```
<|thinking|>
**Financial Metrics Analysis**:
- Debt-to-income ratio: 32% (acceptable, below 36% threshold)
- Loan-to-value ratio: 70% (excellent, well below 80% threshold)
- Credit score: 780 (excellent tier, well above 740)

**Risk Factors Assessment**:
- Employment stability: 8 years (strong positive indicator)
- Down payment: 30% of property value (excellent)
- Property type: Single family (lowest risk category)
- Monthly payment estimate: $2,100 (18% of gross income)

**Regulatory Compliance Check**:
- Meets QM DTI requirements (32% < 43%)
- Sufficient documentation capability
- Property appraisal within normal range

**Overall Risk Profile**:
- Primary risks: Interest rate changes, market volatility
- Mitigation factors: Strong employment, conservative LTV, excellent credit
- Recommendation: APPROVE with standard terms
<|/thinking|>
```

### Key Features to Test

1. **Interactive Charts**: 
   - Risk gauge showing visual risk level
   - Financial metrics comparison with thresholds
   - DTI breakdown pie chart

2. **Compliance Checking**:
   - QM rule validation for mortgages
   - Automated regulatory compliance scoring

3. **Export Functionality**:
   - JSON reports with complete analysis
   - CSV summaries for spreadsheet analysis

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Test different Ollama models in sidebar
   - Compare reasoning quality between models

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Ollama Connection Failed
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Verify model is available
ollama list
```

### 2. Model Not Found
```bash
# Pull recommended model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M

# Alternative lightweight model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

### 3. Memory Issues
- Use smaller model: `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M`
- Reduce max_tokens in config/settings.py
- Close other applications to free memory

### 4. Slow Response Times
- Check system resources (CPU/Memory usage)
- Try smaller model for faster inference
- Reduce temperature for more deterministic responses

## Performance Benchmarks

| Model | Memory Usage | Response Time | Quality Score |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Llama 3.1 8B | ~6GB | 15-30 seconds | Excellent |
| Llama 3.2 3B | ~2.5GB | 8-15 seconds | Good |
| Llama 3.1 70B | ~45GB | 45-90 seconds | Outstanding |

## Advanced Testing

### Custom Risk Thresholds
Edit `config/settings.py` to modify risk assessment criteria:
```python
RISK_THRESHOLDS = {
    "mortgage": {
        "debt_to_income": {
            "excellent": 0.25,  # Stricter than default 0.28
            "good": 0.33,       # Stricter than default 0.36
            "acceptable": 0.40, # Stricter than default 0.43
        }
    }
}
```

### API Integration Testing
The application stores assessment results that can be exported:
```python
# Access via session state
results = st.session_state.assessment_results
json_export = st.session_state.risk_assessor.export_assessment(result)
```

This comprehensive demo setup allows you to test all aspects of the PRefLexOR financial risk assessment system with realistic scenarios and edge cases.
